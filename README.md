# Real-Time Sign Language Detector

## Overview

This project is a real-time sign language detection system designed using Python. It utilizes MediaPipe and OpenCV for live video stream processing and TensorFlow for gesture classification and prediction.

## Features

- Real-time video capture using OpenCV.
- Hand landmark detection using MediaPipe.
- Gesture classification with a TensorFlow-based deep learning model.
- Prediction of sign language gestures.

## Technologies Used

- Python (3.x)
- OpenCV (4.x)
- MediaPipe (latest version)
- TensorFlow (2.x)
- NumPy
- Matplotlib

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/sign-language-detector.git
   cd sign-language-detector

2. **Install dependencies**:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

1. **Running the application**:
   ```bash
   python sign_language_detector.py
   ```

2. **Workflow**:
   - The script opens a live video feed from your webcam.
   - MediaPipe processes the video stream to detect hand landmarks.
   - The TensorFlow deep learning model predicts the corresponding sign language gesture.
   - The predicted gesture is displayed in real-time on the video stream.

## Model Training

1. **Prepare Dataset**:
   - Collect a dataset of sign language gestures.
   - Annotate the dataset with corresponding labels for training.

2. **Train the Model**:
   - Use TensorFlow/Keras to build and train a deep learning model.
   - The model should include layers like Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) layers.

3. **Save the Trained Model**:
   - Save the trained model using TensorFlowâ€™s `save()` method.
   - The saved model can be loaded during real-time inference.
